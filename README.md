# ‚ùáAlgorithm Practice Repository for New Grad CS Students‚ùáÔ∏è

Welcome to the Algorithm Practice Repository! This repo is designed to help new grad Computer Science students prepare for technical interviews by providing a collection of algorithm problems.

## Purpose ‚ù§Ô∏è

The goal of this repository is to help students grind algorithm problems and pass technical interviews. The problems here have been carefully selected to focus on understanding the concepts behind the algorithms, rather than memorization of solutions. Each problem includes a clear explanation and, in most cases, a detailed analysis of time and space complexity.

By working through these problems, you will improve your problem-solving skills and gain a deeper understanding of common data structures and algorithms that are frequently asked in technical interviews.

## Problem Selection üßÆ

The problems in this repo are designed to cover a wide range of topics and difficulty levels. Each problem has been selected not only for its technical challenge but also for its potential to help students understand fundamental algorithmic concepts. The focus is on developing a deeper comprehension of algorithms rather than simply memorizing answers.

## Features üê£
- **Clear Problem Explanations**: Each problem comes with a detailed explanation to help you understand the problem and solution.
- **Time Complexity Analysis**: Most problems include an explanation of the time complexity of the solution.
- **Diverse Topics**: The problems cover various topics including arrays, dynamic programming, trees, graphs, recursion, and more.
